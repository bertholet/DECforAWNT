\chapter{Smoothing Meshes. Or a Geometric Introduction to the Laplace Operator}
	The Laplacian Operator has many very important properties but its meaning is not as easy to grasp at first sight. 
	
	Divergence and Flows and the Heat equation
	
	Gradient
	
	Curl
	
	Sum of Eigenvalues
	
	Surface minimizing property
	
	Maybe....
	
	Laplacian and Differential forms
