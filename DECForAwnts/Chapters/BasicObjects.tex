This chapter introduces the geometric objects exterior calculus (EC) and discrete exterior calculus (DEC) deal with. Everything treated in this thesis is inherently geometric, geometric relations of objects lie at the heart of exterior calculus and discrete exterior calculus, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:2_ECVvsDEC}. Geometric relations are meant in their broadest sense. How is an object oriented relatively to another? What is the geometric boundary of an object? How is a boundary oriented relatively to the interior of the object? The core realization in Chapter \ref{chap:EC} is that the most important differential operators are in some sense nothing else than boundary operators. 


This chapter covers the description of manifolds and some of their geometric features. Local coordinates, tangential spaces, orientations and the border operator are introduced. We also treat how directional derivatives can be computed \emph{on} manifolds, which allows differential calculus on manifolds. These topics form the Section \ref{sec::2_Manifolds} of this chapter.

Section \ref{sec::2_discreteManifolds} treats the discretization of manifolds: simplicial complexes. These allow the definition of orientations and border operators, thereby discretizing the geometric operations introduced on manifolds.

%Throughout this thesis we will always have to deal with two worlds. On one side there is the continuous world, where classical calculus and exterior calculus can be used to describe problems or physical relations. On the other side is the discrete world, where computational calculations can be done and the the smooth world is approximated.

%This chapter focuses the geometric objects in these worlds. On the continuous side these are manifolds, which are the mathematical objects used to describe smooth curved spaces. Manifolds are treated in Section \ref{sec::2_Manifolds}. On the other side we have discrete manifolds, which are multiple dimensional meshes and are introduced in Section \ref{sec::2_discreteManifolds}. Having a correct  understanding of both discrete and continuous manifolds is vital to understand exterior and discrete exterior calculus.

The last section of this chapter is of a more practical nature. It can be used as a guideline when implementing discrete manifolds for DEC. As application some geometric operations on meshes and discrete manifolds are described.

%So lets get started. In this chapter we will have a closer look at the basic objects we will deal with throughout this text.  We start with the description of so called ''manifolds'' which describe smooth surfaces and more generally smooth spaces embedded in higher dimensional spaces.
%In the second section we have a closer look at the meshes (and more generally Simplicial Complexes) that we use in practice in the place of manifolds. The third section explains how to implement meshes and simplicial complexes in a way that is convenient for DEC purposes.

\section{Manifolds}
\label{sec::2_Manifolds}
This section introduces smooth curved spaces, known as manifolds. Some simple two-dimensional manifolds, in short 2-manifolds, are depicted in Figure \ref{fig::2_1_manifold}.

The following topics on manifolds are covered:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describing manifolds using local maps
\item Tangential spaces
\item Orientation of manifolds
\item The border operator and the orientation of borders
\item Differential calculus on manifolds (derivatives of functions on manifolds)
\end{enumerate}

While no application in this thesis actually exceeds three dimensions, exterior calculus and discrete exterior calculus provide tools for arbitrary dimensions, without any complications. 
		
\subsection{Describing Manifolds}	

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[height=4cm]{imgs/2_1_2dmanifolds.eps}
	\end{center}
		\caption{Three simple 2-manifolds; the surfaces of the sphere and the torus do not have any borders, the third surface has. The inner of the sphere and the torus are 3-manifolds with border, their borders being the surfaces.}
		\label{fig::2_1_manifold}
\end{figure}

A two-dimensional manifold is an object that locally looks like $\mathbb{R}^2$ and possibly has one or multiple one dimensional borders. Some examples are given in Figure \ref{fig::2_1_manifold}.

Manifolds are described using local maps. Local maps describe small portions of manifolds. There are two types of maps: maps that describe manifolds around inner points and maps that describe manifolds around border points, as depicted in the Figure \ref{fig::2_1_mapping}. This is taken account of by allowing a local map to either describe the manifold using a plane or a halfplane. A 2-manifold then is an object that can be described at every point locally with a 2 dimensional map. 

Generally, a $k$-dimensional manifold $M$ lying in $\mathbb R^n$ is a geometric object that locally looks like $\mathbb R^k$ or like the halfspace $\mathbb H^k = \{x= (x_1,...,x_k) \in \mathbb R^k : x_k \geq 0\}$.  Formally this is done by guarantying that at every point on the manifold there is a map linking the manifold to $\mathbb R^k$ or $\mathbb H^k$.

For simplicity we assume henceforth that all functions and mappings are infinitely differentiable.
		
		
\begin{definition}[Map] A $k$-dimensional map or parametrization is a differentiable mapping 
\[\phi: U \rightarrow \phi(U)\subset \mathbb R^n\] 
\[\begin{pmatrix}
	u_1\\ \vdots \\ u_k
\end{pmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}x_1(u_1,...,u_k)\\x_2(u_1,...,u_k)\\ \vdots \\ \vdots \\ x_n(u_1,...,u_k)\end{pmatrix}\]
that is injective and whose Jakobimatrix has rank $k$ on all $U$, where $U$ is some open subset of $\mathbb R^k$ or $\mathbb H^k$ (Figure \ref{fig::2_1_mapping}). 		
\end{definition} 

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=14cm]{imgs/2_1_borderedmanifold_maps.eps}
		\caption{An example of a bordered 2-manifold. Left: a local map $\phi$ at some inner point. Right: a local map at a border point. The map at the border has the additional restriction that the border of the halfspace $\mathbb H^2$ is mapped to the border of the manifold.}
		\label{fig::2_1_mapping}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

There are some important details in the definition of maps. The injectivity of the maps prevents self intersecting manifolds, and the constraint on the rank of the Jacobi matrix makes sure that the image of a map $\phi$ does not degenerate. For example the image of a two dimensional map should not degenerate to a point or a line. A $k$-manifold then is an object where you can find local maps everywhere:

\begin{definition}[Manifold] A subset $S\subset \mathbb R^n$ is a $k$-manifold, if for each point $p \in S$ there exist an open set $V\subset \mathbb R^k$ such that there is a map $\phi: U \rightarrow  V\cap S$.
\end{definition} 

\subsubsection{Local Coordinates}

Any local map $\phi: U \subset \mathbb R^k \rightarrow M$ assigns local coordinates to a manifold $M$. The values of the tuple $u=(u_1,...,u_k)\in U$ are called the local coordinates of the point $\phi(u)$, in the map $\phi$. A classic example of coordinates is to parametrize the sphere by two angles using a map like
\[\phi(a,b) = (sin(a)sin(b), sin(a)cos(b), cos(a))\]
This assigns coordinates $(a,b)$ to the sphere in the same way as longitude and latitude are used as coordinate for the world.\footnote{But note that you can not parametrize the whole sphere at once if the source domain of your map is an open set and the map has to be injective.}

Functions $f:M \rightarrow V$ that map the manifold to some arbitrary space $V$, can also be expressed in the local coordinates given by  a map $\phi$. This means that you consider $f \circ \phi : U \subset \mathbb R^k \rightarrow V$ instead of $f$, such that you can use the local coordinates $(u_1,...,u_k)$ as parameters of $f$ instead of the position on the manifold. %(Image : local coordinates..) 

%\subsubsection*{A Note on Coordinates}
%Note that there are two types of coordinates here. Lets look at a 2-Manifold. You can have the local coordinates given by and depending on the local parametrisations you chose (giving you (u,v) coordinates). Then you have the global coordinates of the surrounding space $\mathbb R^3$, assigning (x,y,z) coordinates to every point.
%
%But in the end all coordinates are just descriptive tools; the geometric object we describe is assumed to exist independently of all these parameters. The 'tricky' part then is to get independence of parametrizations when we want to describe geometric properties of our manifolds. Even to get a definition of 'differentiability' on the manifold that is independent of the selected parametrization one must be careful with the definition.
%
%In fact in later applications  we will play around with coordinates, (with surface smoothing in chapter ... the global coordinates, with conformal maps in chapter ... the local coordinates). Rather than taking coordinates as describing the manifolds we take them as something associated to the geometric object to work with them or solve for them.
%
%External calculus (introduced in chapter...) will provide tools and results that do not use parametrizations.

\subsection{Tangential Spaces}		
\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{imgs/2_1_tangent.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{A parametrized curve, the vector $\alpha'$ and the tangential space $T_{\alpha(t_0)}$ at $t_0$.}
\label{fig::2_1_paramCurve}
\end{figure}


Manifolds have tangential spaces.
For curves calculating tangents is easy. If you have a parametrization $\alpha(t): I \subset \mathbb R \to \mathbb R^n$ of some curve $M$, then $$\alpha'(t) = (\alpha_1'(t),\alpha_2'(t),...,\alpha_n'(t))$$ is a tangential vector of the curve at the position $\alpha(t)$. 		While the length of $\alpha'(t)$ at the point $\alpha(t)$ depends on the parametrization $\alpha$,  the \emph{tangential space} $$ T_{\alpha(t)}S = span(\alpha'(t)) = \{x \in \mathbb R^n: x = c \cdot\alpha'(t), c \in \mathbb R\}$$ does only depend of the position $\alpha(t)$ on the curve, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig::2_1_paramCurve}. 
We can do the same for a $k$-dimensional manifold $M$. The tangential space $T_p M$ at a point $p$ can be characterized by any of the following properties. It is:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The linear space that approximates the surface in the best way, locally at $p$.
	\item The space that contains the tangents of all curves on the surface that go through $p$.
	\item For a given parametrization $\phi: \mathbb R^k \to \mathbb R^n$, $\phi(u) = (\phi_1(u),...,\phi_n(u))$ the tangential plane $T_{\phi(u)}$ is given by
			\[span(\frac{\partial \phi} {\partial u_1},..., \frac{\partial \phi} {\partial u_k}) = span(\begin{pmatrix}
	\frac{\partial \phi_1} {\partial u_1} \\
	\frac{\partial \phi_2} {\partial u_1}\\
	\vdots\\
	\frac{\partial \phi_n} {\partial u_1}
\end{pmatrix},...,\begin{pmatrix}
	\frac{\partial \phi_1} {\partial u_k} \\
	\frac{\partial \phi_2} {\partial u_k}\\
	\vdots\\
	\frac{\partial \phi_n} {\partial u_k}
\end{pmatrix}),\]
as depicted in Figure \ref{fig::2_1_mapping_coords} for a 2-manifold. Here the role of the restriction that maps have a Jacobi matrix with full rank is clear, as it means that the partial derivatives are linearly independent.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{imgs/2_1_mapping_coords.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{A map $\phi$ on a 2-manifold $M$ is used to determine the tangential space $T_{p}M$ at some point $p$}
\label{fig::2_1_mapping_coords}
\end{figure}

The tangential space is defined for every point of a manifold. A manifold then is an object with vector spaces glued to all positions. While the tangential spaces $T_pM$  are well defined, the choice of a basis for $T_pM$ is open. Maps $\phi$ induce bases $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial u_i}$, therefore a map can be used not only to parametrize the manifold but also the tangential spaces. But note that, just as it is the case in Figure \ref{fig::2_1_mapping_coords}, these vectors are in general not orthogonal or normalized. \note{could put scalar product here}

%One special example of a manifold is  the space $\mathbb R^k$ seen as a manifold parametrized by $\mathbb R^k$ with $\phi = id$. Then the tangential space $T_p \mathbb R^k$ at any point $p$ is again $\mathbb R^k$. But still: the vectors in one tangential space $T_p \mathbb R^k$ and the vectors of another tangential space $T_q \mathbb R^k$ can not be mixed; every point gets its own proper tangential space, not shared with any other point.
		
\subsection{Orientations}

In the previous section we introduced tangential spaces and emphasized that every point gets its own proper tangential vector space. Tangential spaces of points that are close together are very similar and it makes sense to ask them to have the same \emph{orientation}. Also a manifold is oriented by orienting its tangential spaces. 

The orientation of volumes and manifolds is, together with the border operator, the geometric property that plays the most important part in EC and DEC. But what is orientation? Orientation is to assign signs to volumes. A volume can be positive or negative. To decide which it is, you need a reference- you can only say how a volume is oriented relative to something.

%In the previous section we introduced tangential spaces and emphasized that every point gets its own proper tangential vector space. Tangential spaces of points that are very close together are very similar and it makes sense to ask them to have the same orientation. 
%We only want to consider a special kind of manifolds: orientable manifolds. Orienting a volume is to assign a sign to the volume you are treating. Either your volume is positive or negative. 

For a vector space you can encode orientation in the ordering of basis vectors. Two ordered bases $v_1,...v_k$ and $w_1,...,w_k$ describe the same orientation if the matrix that describes the change of bases has a positive determinant. If a base is chosen, the determinant can also be used to measures the signed volume spanned by a set of vectors.

%In the previous section we introduced tangential spaces and emphasized that every point gets its own proper tangential vector space. Tangential spaces of points that are very close together are very similar and it makes sense to ask them to have the same orientation.

%In the last section we introduced tangential spaces and 

Local maps provide bases for tangential spaces. One single parametrization induces consistent orientations to the tangential spaces of all points it hits. Therefore we say that a manifold is oriented if all tangential spaces are oriented consistently:

\begin{definition}[Oriented Manifold] A manifold is \emph{orientable} if there exists a set of maps $\mathcal A = \{\phi: U_\phi \to \phi(U_\phi) \subset M\}$ such that the maps describe the whole manifold and any two maps $\phi$, $\psi$ which describe a common patch $\psi(U_\psi) \cap \phi(U_\phi)$ result in the same orientations i.e. the base change matrix $C$ from the base $D\phi$ to $D\psi$ has a positive determinant
\[det(C) >0\]
A manifold is \emph{oriented} if for all tangential spaces a consistent orientation has been chosen.

\end{definition}

For 2-manifolds in $\mathbb R^3$, orienting a surface is equivalent to consistently choose a surface normal, as tried in Figure \ref{fig::2_1_mobius}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 6cm]{imgs/2_1mobius.eps}
\caption{The Moebius strip, the pathological example of a non orientable manifold.}
\label{fig::2_1_mobius}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Border Operator}
The border operator describes a special geometric operation for manifolds. 
We denote the border of a manifold $M$ by $\delta M$ and call $\delta$ the border operator. From the definition of maps at border points follows that the border of a manifold is again a manifold, where the dimension decreases by one. The border of a manifold always is a manifold without border, as can be seen with spheres or tori (see Figure \ref{fig::2_1_manifold}). This border of a border of a manifold is empty
\[\delta\delta M = \emptyset.\]

A central point  is that an oriented manifold induces an orientation to its border. Therefore you can define that the border operator $\delta$ takes an oriented manifold and returns an oriented manifold with an induced orientation.  This is sketched in Figure \ref{fig::2_1_borderManifold}.  What follows is a short technical description of how the induced orientation on the border is defined formally. %The border operator and the border orientations play a central role in external calculus and throughout this thesis. Therefore it deserves to be introduced properly.

 As the orientation of a manifold is defined by the orientation of its tangential spaces we need to take a closer look at the tangential spaces of bordered manifolds.
At boundary points two tangential spaces are present. One is the tangential space of the manifold $T_pM$ and $k$ dimensional, the other one is the $k-1$ dimensional tangential space of the border manifold $T_p \delta M$, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig::2_1_borderManifold} (left) . Inducing an orientation to the border means inducing an orientation to $T_p\delta M$ using the orientation of $T_p M$. This happens by defining normals on the border.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 13cm]{imgs/2_1_borderedManifold_combined.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{On bordered manifold two tangential spaces $T_pM$ and $T_p\delta M$  are present at boundary points. $N$ is the outward pointing border normal (left image). The base $(b_1,b_2)$ is oriented according to the manifold. The induced border orientation is given by a vector $\widetilde{b}$ such that  $(N, \widetilde{b})$ is oriented like $b_1,b_2$.}
\label{fig::2_1_borderManifold}
\end{figure}

For any border point one can define a border normal $N$. The border normal $N$ is the vector in $T_p M$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$ is orthogonal to $T_p \delta M$
\item $N$ has length 1
\item $N$ points outside
\end{itemize}
%Pointing outside is defined formally using the map $h$ at the border; $Dh$ is a linear bijective map from $\mathbb R^k$ to $T_pM$, so $N$ can be pulled back to $\mathbb R^k$ and it points 'outside' if the $k$th component of $Dh^{-1} N$ is negative \note{(Image?)}.

Orientation is encoded in the enumeration of basis vectors. If $b_1,...,b_k$ gives the orientation of $T_pM$,
a basis $\widetilde{b_1},...,\widetilde{ b}_{k-1}$ of the tangential space of the border $T_p\delta M$ is oriented according to the manifold, if prepending the normal $N$ to the basis leads to a basis $(N,\widetilde{b_1},...,\widetilde{ b}_{k-1})$ that has the same orientation as $b_1,...,b_k$. This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig::2_1_borderManifold}.


\subsection{Differential Calculus on Manifolds}
\label{sec::2_derivativesOnMF}
So far we have seen tangential spaces, orientations and the border operator. The last property of smooth manifolds that needs to be covered is that manifolds allow differentiation to be done \emph{on} them. In this section we explain how mappings $f:M\to M'$ between two manifolds $M$ and $M'$ are differentiated \emph{on} the manifolds.  With this, manifolds become  more than geometric objects; they become spaces where differential calculus is possible, just as it is on $\mathbb R^n$. %The manifolds get a \textbf{differential structure}.

\subsubsection{Total Derivative}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height= 4.5cm]{imgs/3_1_manifoldDerivative.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Construction of a derivative of a real valued function $f$ defined on a manifold locally parametrized by $\phi$. $Df$ at a point $p$ is a linear mapping from the tangential space $T_p M$ to $\mathbb R$}
\label{fig::3_1_manifoldDerivative}
\end{figure}

Given a manifold $M$ and a function $f: M \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$, what is the total derivative of $f$? We want the derivative to be something very similar to the total derivative $Dh$ of a function $h: \mathbb R^k \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$. In this case $Dh$ is the linear mapping that locally approximates $h$ and can be used to give the directional derivative for a direction $v$.
\[h( p + tv) \approx h(p) + Dh(p) \cdot tv\]
We want the same for functions $f$ on manifolds: $Df$ should be a linear mapping that maps a direction to the vector that describes the change of $f$ when going in that direction. But a direction on a manifold at some position is a tangential vector. Therefore, the differential $Df$ is a mapping from the \emph{tangential spaces} to vectors.

We can express the idea that $Df\cdot v$ describes the change of $f$ in the direction $v$ readily by using a curve $\alpha (t)$ with a tangent $\frac{\partial \alpha(0)}{\partial t} = v$ in the wished direction $v$, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig::3_1_manifoldDerivative} :
\begin{equation} Df \cdot v := \frac{\partial}{\partial t} f(\alpha(t)) \label{eq:2_1_derivativeDef}\end{equation}
As $f(\alpha(t))$ is simply a function $\mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ we know how to calculate the right hand side $\frac{\partial}{\partial t} f(\alpha(t))$. We can also express the derivative in the local coordinates given by a parametrization $\phi(u_1,...,u_k)$.


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width= 13cm]{imgs/3_1_manifoldDerivative2.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Two 2-manifolds $M$ and $M'$ with local parametrizations $\phi$ and $\psi$ and a mapping $f: M \rightarrow M'$. The total derivative $Df$ at a point $p$ is a linear mapping from the tangential space $T_p M$ to $T_{f(p)} M'$. $D\phi$ and $D \psi$ parametrize the tangential spaces and $Df$ can be represented as a $2\times 2$ matrix.}
\label{fig::3_1_manifoldDerivative2}
\end{figure}


As we have seen, a parametrization provides a base for the tangential space, namely 
\[\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial u_1},..., \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial u_k}\] 
We then express $\alpha$, $f$ and the tangential vector $\alpha'$ in the map $\phi$:
\begin{eqnarray*} \alpha(t) &=& \phi(u_1(t),...,u_k(t))\\
\alpha'(t) &=& \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial u_1} u_1' + ... + \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial u_k} u_k'\\
 f(u_1,...,u_k) &=& f(\phi(u_1,...,u_k)) \\
 &=& f_1(\phi(u_1,...,u_k)),...,f_n(\phi(u_1,...,u_k)). \end{eqnarray*} 
Then Equation \ref{eq:2_1_derivativeDef} becomes
\[Df \cdot \alpha'(t) = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}f(u_1(t),...,u_k(t)) = (\frac{\partial f}{\partial u_1},..., \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_k}) \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
	u_1' \\ \vdots \\ u_k'\end{pmatrix}\]
Therefore, $Df$ \emph{in the local coordinates given by $\phi$} is given by the $ n \times k$ matrix $(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u_1},..., \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_k})$ and if some tangential vector $v$ is described in the same map $v = v_1 \frac{\partial \phi}{u_1} +...+ v_k \frac{\partial \phi}{u_k}$:
\[Df \cdot v = (\frac{\partial f}{\partial u_1},..., \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_k}) \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
	v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_k\end{pmatrix}\]



%The curve $\alpha$ was only used to construct the derivative; written without $\alpha$ the derivative $Df$ in local coordinates $\phi$ is:
%\[Df \cdot v = (\frac{\partial f}{\partial u_1},..., \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_k}) \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
%	v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_k\end{pmatrix}\]
%where the tangential vector $v$ is expressed in the base of the tangential space induced by $\phi$
%\[v = v_1 \frac{\partial \phi}{u_1} +...+ v_k \frac{\partial \phi}{u_k}\] 
%\subsubsection{The Gradient}
%The simplest differential operator is the gradient. In $\mathbb R^n
 
\subsubsection*{Mappings between Manifolds}
\label{sec:derivativeBetweenMfs}
We can also consider the total derivative of mappings going from one manifold $M$ to an other manifold $M'$,
\[f:M\to M'\]
as shown in Figure \ref{fig::3_1_manifoldDerivative2}. We look again at Equation \ref{eq:2_1_derivativeDef}:
\[Df \cdot v := \frac{\partial}{\partial t} f(\alpha(t))\]
Note that $f(\alpha(t))$ is a curve on $M'$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}f(\alpha(t))$ therefore is a tangential vector to this curve and lies in $T_{f(\alpha(t))}M'$. Then $Df\cdot v$ has to be a vector in the tangential space of $M'$. This means that the derivative $D_pf$ at some point $p$ is a linear mapping from the tangential space $T_pM$  to the tangential space $T_{f(p)} M'$, i.e. 
\[D_p f = T_p M \rightarrow T_{f(p)} M'.\] 

If $M$ is a $k$-manifold and $M'$ a $l$-manifold, $Df$ can be expressed as a $l\times k$ matrix, described relatively to two sets of local coordinates $\phi \rightarrow M$ and $\psi \rightarrow M'$.

\subsection{Summary}
Manifolds are objects with geometric features, for example the orientation of volume and the definition of a border operator, but they also allow differential calculus on their surfaces. Tangential spaces play a crucial role by allowing local properties to be pointwisely defined on them and differentiation leads to linear mappings between tangential spaces.

\section{Implementation Notes}
This chapters provides a guideline of what needs to be implemented to get DEC and the later applications up and running. The components needed are described and some of the more tricky details are mentioned.

\subsection{A word on Sparse Matrices}
The point of DEC is to reformulate differential equations using sparse matrices. Therefore any implementation of DEC is somewhat centered around sparse matrices.

If you plan to implement your DEC framework you should start by looking for a sparse matrix solver. For all results in this thesis the sparse Solver from the Pardiso-Project of the University of Basel has been used as a black box solver \cite{pardiso1}. Unfortunately it is not free-ware but any other sparse solver will do as well.

%Sparse matrices are matrices where most entries are zero. Instead of storing all $n\times m$ values of a matrix, you choose to only store the non-zero values and their indices. There are different ways to do this; the pardiso solver uses the so called Yale format.

The pardiso solver uses the so called Yale format. The Yale format uses 3 vectors to describe an arbitrary $n\times m$ matrix $A$. The first vector $a$ stores all non-zero values of $A$, enumerated by row. The second vector $ja$ stores the column indices of the non-zero values, again enumerated by row. The third vector $ia$ stores for every row the index $ind$, such that $a(ind)$ and $ja(ind)$ are the value and the column of the first element in the row. Additionally one appends the length of the vector $a$ to $ia$.

For example 
\[\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 &3 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 &2 \\
 0 & 4&2&0
\end{pmatrix} \Rightarrow \begin{cases} a &= [1,3,2,4,2]\\ ja &= [0,3,3,1,2] \\ ia &= [0,2,3,5]  \end{cases}\]
Iterating over the values and indices of the $k$th row then amounts to
\begin{algorithmic}
\FOR{i = ia(k):ia(k+1)}

%Whatever implementation of sparse matrices you choose to use or implement, the usual basic operations need to be implemented: multiplication and addition of matrices, transposing matrices etc.

\subsection{Implementing Simplicial 2-Complexes}
\label{sec::2_handsOnSimplicialComplexes}
The applications in this thesis focus on 2-complexes, i.e., classical triangle meshes. You might not need any more general implementation. General $k$-complexes are treated separately in the next section. 

For DEC we need the complete geometric information of meshes; we have to explicitly keep lists of vertices, edges and faces, the full information about their incidence and border relations, as well as their assigned orientations. 

For 2D meshes a winged edge structure is a convenient choice of representation. In a winged edge structure you have the following three objects: vertices, edges and faces, as described in Figure \ref{figs::2_1_wingedEdge}. Edges are stored once, with an arbitrary chosen orientation. With this information present it is easy to do things like iterating over the incident edges or faces of a vertex or iterate over the edges of a border component following the orientation of the mesh.

Note that, even thought the incidence information is stored in a winged mesh structure, for DEC applications the discrete border operator matrices $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$ still need to be computed.

	\label{fig::2_1_Complex}%
\end{figure}

Chances are you do not need simplicial complexes of higher dimensions other than tetrahedral meshes embedded in $\mathbb R^3$. But one straight forward and for DEC suitable way to implement arbitrary $k$-complexes is to store lists of simplices and represent the incidence information explicitly with the sparse border matrices. The border operator matrices play a central role in DEC and need to be set up anyway.

Figure \ref{fig::2_1_Complex} depicts a possible implementation of $k$-complexes.  A $k$-complex consists of $k+1$ simplex lists and of the border matrices $\delta_1,...,\delta_k$. The vertices (0-Simplices) store their positions. A $j$-simplex is represented by a $j$-tuple of vertex indices, these are the indices of the vertices in the list kept in the $k$-complex data structure. The index tuples describing the simplices are sorted i.e.
\[(i_1,i_2,...,i_j): i_1 < i_2 <...<i_j.\] 
Sorted tuples facilitate the computation of the relative orientation of a $j-1$ simplex $(v_0,...,\widehat{v_l},..., v_{j})$ lying on the border of a $j$ simplex $(v_0,...,\widehat{v_l},..., v_{j})$. By the definition of the border operator from Section \ref{sec::2_borderOrientation} their relative orientation simply is:
\[relativeOrientation = (-1)^l\]
The orientation of most simplices of an oriented simplicial $k$-complex can be chosen arbitrarily and we choose the orientation that is defined by the sorted index tuples. Only the $k$-simplices of an oriented $k$-complex have to be oriented consistently. Therefore, they get an additional 'orientation` variable in which is stored if the orientation induced by the ordered tuple is positive or negative relative to the orientation of the $k$-complex.


\subsubsection{Setting Up a k-Complex}
Setting up the border operator matrices $\delta_j$ for complexes of arbitrary dimensions can be a fuzz, as you need to excessively compute relative orientations of simplices. Supposing that you have a wireframe model of the $k$-complex, i.e. a list of vertex positions and a list of $k$-simplices, the full $k$-complex  with all incidence matrices can be set up in the following way:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Reorder the index tuples of the $k$-simplices and adapt the orientation accordingly
	\item Generate all the $j$-simplex lists
	\item Set up the matrices $\delta_j$
\end{enumerate}


%But while it is easier to compute relative orientations if the indices of your simplices are sorted, you loose the ability to store arbitrary simplex orientations using the ordering of vertices. For all but the $k$ simplices this does not matter, even for oriented discrete $k$-manifolds, as there is nor 'right' or 'wrong' orientation and all that matters is that you consistently use the same orientation all the time. But for the $k$ simplices in an oriented $k$ manifold you really need to be able to chose the orientation, so you have to keep track of the orientation independently in an additional variable (as is done in Figure \ref{fig::2_1_Complex}).

\textbf{Reordering tuples: } When reordering the tuples in the first step, you need to keep track of how the orientation changes. This can be done using a so called \emph{inversion table}. Lets say the tuple $(i_1,...,i_n)$ is a permutation of the tuple $(1,2...,n)$. An inversion is an index pair $(i_l,i_k)$, where $l<k$ but $i_l >i_k$, i.e. the order of $i_l,i_k$ is inverted. The relative orientation of the simplex $\{i_1,...,i_n\}$ and the ordered simplex $\{1,2...,n\}$ is $(-1)^{\#inversions}$ where $\#inversions$ is the total number of inversions.

In the inversion table you count for every index in the tuple the number of elements on its left that are greater. Example: 
\begin{align*}
permuted \;\; tuple & &3,2,5,4,1 \\
inversions & & 0,1,0,1,4
\end{align*}
The first line represents the permuted indices the lower the number of inversions of every index. The total number of inversion is  1+1+4 =6 and the relative orientation of
$\{3,2,5,4,1\}$ to $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ is $(-1)^6 = 1$.

\textbf{Setting up incidence matrices:}
After the steps 1 and 2, all simplices in the simplicial complex have a fixed orientation. Setting up the border matrix $\delta_j$ is then described in Figure \ref{alg:deltaj} 

\begin{figure}
%\begin{tabular}[c]

\begin{algorithmic}
\FOR{ind1 = (0:$\# j$-$simplices$)}
	\STATE \emph{//the j-simplex number ind1}
	\STATE $\{i_0,...,i_j\} \gets j$-$simplex[$ind1$]$   
	\STATE \emph{//Iterate of the bordering j-1 simplices}
	\FOR{l=(0:j)}
		\STATE \emph{//Find the index of the bordering j-1 simplex}
		\STATE ind2 $\gets index(\{i_0,...,\widehat{i_l},...,i_j\})$ 
		\STATE \emph{//Store the relative orientation in $\delta_j$}
		\STATE $\delta_j($ind1,ind2$) \gets (-1)^l$
	\ENDFOR
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
%\end{tabular}
\caption{An algorithm to set up the incidence matrix $\delta_j$.}
\label{alg:deltaj}
\end{figure}
		
\subsection{Simple Example Applications}
Using the border matrices you can easily check if a mesh is well oriented or compute the border components of a mesh.

	
%\subsubsection{Set Up Border Matrices}
%If you chose a winged edge structure to implement 2-complexes, you additionally need to set up the border matrices $\delta_2$ and $\delta_1$. Store them directly with your mesh. These matrices play a central role in all DEC applications.
\subsubsection{Orientation Test}
That a $k$-complex is oriented can be checked by looking at $\delta_k$. The condition we gave in Section \ref{sec::2_orientedDiscreteMF} for a $k$-complex to be oriented was the following: any $k-1$ simplex is either a border simplex, therefore being part of exactly one $k$-simplex, or it is part of two $k$-simplices, having once positive and once negative orientation. 

This is exactly the case if any column of $\delta_k$ has either exactly one entry or two entries: a one and a minus one. 


\subsubsection{Check if a 2-Complex is a Discrete Manifold}
\begin{figure}[tb]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=12cm]{imgs/2_3_danglingTeapot.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{A teapot mesh that on the first look seems to be a discrete borderless 2-manifold but turns out to be a mesh with border and dangling triangles, which makes it a non-manifold mesh and therefore not suited for some DEC applications}
	\label{fig:2_badteapot}
\end{figure}

DEC applications might fail if a complex is not a discrete manifold. Two dimensional meshes used for displaying purposes are often not discrete manifold. To avoid singular matrices and to eliminate the possibility that bugs occur due to the ill-formedness of a mesh it is good to test a mesh for manifoldness before using it. The mesh in Figure \ref{fig:2_badteapot} is an example of a non manifold mesh that leads to unexpected results.

%To avoid singular matrices and to eliminate the possibility that bugs occur due to the ill-formedness of a $k$-complex or mesh (as in Fig. \ref{fig::2_2_dangling} and \ref{fig::2_2_borderUnoriented}) it is handy to have such a test method. I.e. you should test for orientation errors and the connectedness to avoid dangling simplices.
%The orientation needs to be checked for $k$ simplices only, which would be for example the faces for a 2D-mesh. 

%That a $k$-complex is oriented can be checked by looking at $\delta_k$. Any column has to have either exactly one entry or two entries that sum up to zero. This checks exactly the condition we gave in \ref{sec::2_orientedDiscreteMF}: Any 1 simplex is either on the border (therefore being part of exactly one $k$ simplex) or between 2 $k$-simplices, having once positive and once negative orientation.

In a winged edge mesh, finding dangling faces is fairly simple; at every vertex iterate over all edges and make sure that either exactly 2 or no edges have only one neighbor face.
%\begin{figure}
%	\begin{center}
%	\includegraphics[height=3cm]{imgs/2_3_danglingTriangles.eps}
%	\vspace{0.5cm}
%	
%	%\includegraphics[width=10cm]{imgs/2_3_DanglingTetrahedra.eps}
%	\end{center}
%	\caption{On the left all 2-simplices (triangles) can be reached indirectly by hopping from triangle to triangle where every hopping pair shares a 1-simpex (considering only triangles that neighbour the marked vertex). On the right the manifold property is violated.}% Bottom: two 3-simplices that share a common face (no dangling), that share an edge (dangling) and that share a vertex (dangling)}
%	\label{fig::2_3_dangling}
%\end{figure}
%Detecting dangling $k$-simplices in a $k$-complex needs slightly more work. Formally dangling was prevented by asking that at any vertex, the incident $k$-simplices form either a ball or a half ball. This is equivalent to asking that any two $k$ simplices neighbouring some vertex $v_0$ are connected via $k$ simplices neighbouring $v_0$ that share $k-1$ faces, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig::2_3_dangling}.  So to check wellformedness at a vertex, take all neighbour $k$-simplices, choose one and put it on a stack. Pop the stack and push all $k$-simplices that share a $k-1$ face with the popped simplex. Keep on popping and pushing like this. If any $k$ simplex remains you have a dangling situation. \note{(Clear enough?)}
	
	
%Note that these non-manifold detection algorithms will not detect non-manifoldness due to self intersections (like the most right situation in Fig. \ref{fig::2_2_dangling}), as such problems do not show in the incidence matrices. But for most applications it is enough that we have well-formed incidence matrices and do not care if such self intersections occur.
	
\subsubsection{Find Borders}
Given an oriented discrete $k$-manifold: find the $(k-1)$-complex that represents its border. Finding the border can be easily done by applying the border Operator $\delta_k$ to the $(1,1,1,1,1...)$ vector. The resulting vector then exactly represents the border manifold. If multiple borders are present the connected components of this border have to be computed in a separate step.
	
%\subsubsection{Get Connected Components of a set of K-Simplices}
%It also comes in handy to be able to identify the different connected components of a mesh, as the different components a mesh often need to be treated independently from each other as separate objects.
%	
%Given a list of $k$-simplices which forms one or more discrete manifolds you should identify the different connected components. You can also apply this
%to the border of a $k$ manifold with multiple borders to get the various border components as in Figure \ref{fig::2_3_bunnyBorder}.
