\noindent Discrete exterior calculus (DEC) is a mathematical theory that provides tools to discretize differential equations defined on manifolds. DEC is directly defined on simplicial complexes and has successfully been used in various computer graphic applications. This thesis is an introduction to DEC, 
accessible to any reader with a basic knowledge of multidimensional calculus. 

We develop DEC alongside of exterior calculus (EC) %, rather than developing DEC as an independent theory. 
%Like this DEC profits directly from insights in EC and vice versa. 
and emphasize the geometric aspects of both theories in order to put across the insights behind their formalisms. More advanced DEC and EC results are given in the context of applications, where their relevance is demonstrated at once. The use of DEC is demonstrated in the context of surface parametrization, vector field design and fluid simulations. 

This thesis provides a working knowledge of both exterior calculus and discrete exterior calculus, enabling a reader to apply and adapt DEC to new problems and to follow reasonings made using EC.
