	\subsection{Point Carre Lemma}
	When is a form d or delta of another form?
	\subsection{General Laplacian}
	The Laplacian is as well d as delta of another form...
	\subsection{Hodge Decomposition}
	Splitting Forms
	\subsection{Application: Vector Field Design}
	Using all this for Vector Field Design
	\subsection{Border Constraints}
	How borders can be treated but it affects everything.
