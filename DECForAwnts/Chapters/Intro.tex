	\section{General Setting}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item From equations to Meshes.
		\end{itemize}
	\section{A Glimpse of DEC}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Derivative as a simple example 
			\item vs FEM 
			\item show a picture of the deRahm complex saying that this diagram helps you translate Differential Operators into Matrices.
		\end{itemize}

	\section{A Tour to this Thesis}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item	Structure of this Thesis: Goal: acquire founded knowledge about DEC. The Thesis as three pillars: smooth Theory, discrete theory and application/implementation of example problems. The Smooth Theory we try to discretize is introduced alongside the corresponding discrete version of the Theory, such that you understand  the reasons and assumptions behind it. With an emphasis to get an intuitive understanding of the smooth theory rather than giving a rigorous mathematical introduction. Every chapter gets a table describing what is introduced and where it belongs to.
		
		\item Short trailer like chapter by chapter overview, one image per chapter.
