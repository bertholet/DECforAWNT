	\subsection{Motivation: The perfect thing to integrate}
		Have a look at what you need when taking an integral: an either symmetric or antisymmetric form taking
		vectors from the tangential space
	\subsection{Forms and Differential Forms}
		Concretize The space of multilinear antisymmetric functions: bases, dimension, wedge. Define Differentialforms
	\subsection{What Forms are in $\mathbb{R}^3$}
		Using a metric (or simply by saying we look only at embedded manifolds with induced metric) we can associate
		Vector fields etc to Forms.
	\subsection{Integrating Forms}
		Now again lets have a look at integration of Diffforms.
	\subsection{Discrete Forms}
		What discrete forms are and where they live
	\subsubsection{Sampling Forms}
		How you sample vectorfields etc / what the sampled values mean. Here the duality of forms already emerges.

		\hline
	\end{longtable}
	\subsection{Gradient, Curl, Divergence}
		Geometric Definition of gradient, curl and divergence, maybe plus reduction to 'standard' $\nabla$ operator when using apporpriate coordinates.
	\subsection{Differential Operator}
		The operators above take a form of one type and return an other.
		Introduce the $d$.
	\subsection{Stokes Theorem}
		To what depth this is proven is open, as this needs bordered manifolds and i don't know if I want to look at them
		Maybe proof SKETCH, because this result is astonishing.
		Known examples and special cases. Cases where it does not hold.
	\subsection{Discrete Differential Operator}
		Using stokes Theorem we introduce the discrete $d$ as the conjugate of the border operator
	\subsection{Duality: We want more}
		Not all operators can be built yet. Introduce Star, duality
	\subsection{Dual Mesh and Star Operator}
		Discrete Version of this.
	\subsection{The 0 Form Laplacian from the beginning}
		Now easy to write that guy down.

	\subsection{Implementaion: Conformal Embedding}
		How its done. Pretty straight forward if you have the machinery. Different Border Constraints. Mention MeanValue Weights?
	\subsection{Dimension of Harmonic Space?}
		Looking at results and topology. Genus, Bettinumbers, DeRham Complex?	Would be nice..
		Mention cutting algorithms like the quad mesh paper..
